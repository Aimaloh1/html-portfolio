<h1>Meeting Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi there! I am someone who finds joy in solving problems, building useful
  things, and constantly learning. I have a growing background in technology,
  particularly in DevOps, network engineering, and web development. My
  experience ranges from configuring switches and routers to deploying
  cloud-native applications and setting up CI/CD pipelines. I believe that every
  challenge is a chance to sharpen my skills and grow into the professional I
  aspire to b.
</p>

<p>
  My journey began with a curiosity about how digital systems work. That
  curiosity turned into hands-on exploration, academic training, and industry
  experience. Whether it is automating tasks with scripts, optimizing
  deployments with Azure DevOps, or learning how front-end and back-end systems
  interact, I find the process both challenging and rewarding. I have worked
  with international teams and vendors, which has deepened my adaptability and
  collaborative mindset.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of work, I am committed to personal growth. I am currently enhancing
  my skills in software development and DevOps, while also preparing for
  certifications like the CCNA. Fitness and wellness are important to me, and I
  enjoy balancing the intensity of tech life with the discipline of workouts and
  healthy living. I am passionate about staying grounded while reaching higher —
  professionally and personally.
</p>

<p>
  In the long term, I see myself contributing meaningfully to the fintech and
  technology sectors. I am driven by impact — whether it is streamlining a
  deployment process, improving infrastructure reliability, or mentoring others
  who are just starting out. My goal is to build a career rooted in innovation,
  efficiency, and purpose.
